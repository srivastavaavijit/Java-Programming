In Java, data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold. They are broadly categorized into two main types: primitive types and reference types.

1. Primitive Data Types
These are the most basic data types and include:

int: Integer values (e.g., int age = 25;)
double: Floating-point numbers (e.g., double price = 19.99;)
char: Single 16-bit Unicode characters (e.g., char initial = 'A';)
boolean: Represents true or false values (e.g., boolean isJavaFun = true;)
byte: 8-bit integer (e.g., byte b = 100;)
short: 16-bit integer (e.g., short s = 10000;)
long: 64-bit integer (e.g., long l = 100000L;)
float: 32-bit floating-point number (e.g., float pi = 3.14f;)
2. Reference Data Types
These types refer to objects and can hold references to data rather than the data itself:

Classes: User-defined data types (e.g., String name = "John";)
Arrays: Collections of similar data types (e.g., int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};)
Interfaces: Abstract data types that define a contract for classes.
