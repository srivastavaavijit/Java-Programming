Identifiers in Java are names used to identify variables, classes, methods, and other user-defined items. 

Rules for Naming Identifiers:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Character Set: Identifiers can include letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).
Starting Character: Identifiers must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign; they cannot start with a digit.
Case Sensitivity: Identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning variable, Variable, and VARIABLE are considered different.
Length: There is no strict limit on the length of identifiers, but keeping them concise is good practice.
Keywords: Identifiers cannot be keywords (reserved words) in Java, such as class, public, or void.
