Loops in Java allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. 
Java provides several types of loops, each serving different purposes:

1. for loop:
-------------------
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}

2. while loop:
--------------------
The while loop continues executing as long as the specified condition is true. It checks the condition before each iteration.
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}

3. do-while loop:
--------------------
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block will execute at least once, as the condition is checked after the execution.
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);

Example:
----------------
public class LoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // For Loop
        System.out.println("For Loop:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
        }

        // While Loop
        System.out.println("\nWhile Loop:");
        int j = 1;
        while (j <= 5) {
            System.out.println("Iteration: " + j);
            j++;
        }

        // Do-While Loop
        System.out.println("\nDo-While Loop:");
        int k = 1;
        do {
            System.out.println("Iteration: " + k);
            k++;
        } while (k <= 5);
    }
}
